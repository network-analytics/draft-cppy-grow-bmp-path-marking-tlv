      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
      BGP path information, which is is conveyed through  BMP Route
      Monitoring (RM) messages. This document specifies a BMP extension to
      convey the status of a path after being processed by the BGP process.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Multiple paths with different path status, (e.g., the "best path",
      "backup path", "invalid", and so on), may co-exist for a given prefix in
      the BGP RIBs after being processed by the BGP decision process.  The path
      status information is not carried in the BGP Update Message
      <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref> or in the BMP Route Monitoring Message <xref
          target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

      <t>External systems can use the path status for various applications.
      For example, operators commonly use path status during  
      troubleshooting. Having such status stored and tracked 
      enables the development of tools that facilitate this process.
      Optimization systems can consider path status in their process, e.g.,
      as a validation source (since it can compare the
      calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as primary
      and backup path). Moreover, path status information can
      complement other centralized sources of data. For example, flow
      collectors can leverage it to identify the exact forwarding paths,
          yielding more accurate traffic matrices than existing methods.</t>

      <t>This document defines a Path Status TLV to convey the BGP
      path status to a BMP server. The BMP Path Status TLV is carried in the
      BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message  <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

            <t>An invalid route is a route that does not enter the BGP 
                decision process as indicated in <xref target="RFC4271" sectionFormat="of" section="9.1.2">RFC4271</xref>.
            </t>

            <t>Nonselected routes are those that are not selected in the BGP
            decision process. Backup routes are considered nonselected,
            while the best and primary routes are not considered as
            nonselected.</t>

            <t>A primary route is a path used for traffic forwarding.  See

                            The best path is also a primary path.</t>

            <t>A backup path is installed in the RIB, but it is not used
            until some or all primary paths become unreachable. Backup paths
            are used for fast convergence in the event of primary path failures.</t>

            <t>A non-installed path refers to the route that is not installed
            into the IP routing table.</t>

            <t>Filtered in outbound policy routes are those that are filtered in the Adj-RIB-Out policy</t>

            <t>Stale routes refer to paths which have been declared stale by the BGP
            Graceful Restart mechanism, as described in <xref

<section anchor="path-marking-stats" title="Path Marking Statistics">

  <t>
    This section defines statistics to account for the usage of the Path
    Status TLV in Route Monitoring (RM) messages. The statistics specified
    in this section are exported by BMP speakers using the Stats Reports
    message type defined in <xref target="RFC7854">Section 4.8 of</xref>.
  </t>

  <t>
    Unless otherwise stated, all counters defined in this section are
    unsigned 64-bit integers. Counters are maintained per BMP session and
    per monitored peer, and their reset behavior (for example, upon BMP
    session restart or operator-triggered reset) follows the general
    semantics of BMP Stats Reports as defined in <xref target="RFC7854">
    RFC7854</xref>.
  </t>

  <section title="Per-Status Counters">

    <t>
      For each IANA-registered Path Status bit defined in
      <xref target="status_codes"/>, an implementation SHOULD maintain a
      counter that reflects the number of paths currently marked with that
      status.  These counters are conceptually similar to the per-status
      gauges defined for primary, backup, stale, and suppressed routes in
      the BMP RIB statistics document.

          Type = &IANA_PM_STATS_FILTERED_IN;:

        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      Since the Path Status field is encoded as a bitmap, multiple status
      bits can be set for a single path.  The corresponding per-status
      counters are incremented independently; that is, a single path may
      contribute to more than one per-status counter.

    <section title="Implementation notes">

        <t>The BMP path marking TLV remains optional within BMP
            implementations.</t>

        <t>An implementation of the BMP path marking TLV may not fully support
        marking of all status defined in <xref target="status_codes"/> or
        any future extensions. Similarly, an implementation may choose to
        support the inclusion of the reason code (for which support is also
            optional), without necessarily incorporating any of the reason
            codes defined in <xref target="reasons_codes"/> or future
                extensions.</t>

        <t>This document refrains from defining mechanisms for signaling the
            status or reason codes an implementation supports. This could be
            established through external means (e.g. documentation) or
            potentially addressed in a subsequent document.</t>

        <t>The remainder of this section covers additional points related
            to the implementation of the BMP Path marking TLV.</t>

        <section title="Configuration of BMP path marking">

            <t>Implementations supporting the BMP path marking TLV should
            provide an option for enabling/disabling the Path Marking
                TLV over BMP monitoring sessions. Furthermore,  the configuration options
            for this TLV should provide the means to enable/disable the
                transmission of reason codes, if the reason codes are supported by the
                implementation.</t>

        </section>


        <section title="Scalability and churn">

            <t>The Path Marking TLV introduces metadata on the routes, which 
            could increase the churn (<xref target="RFC4098" sectionFormat="of"
                section="8.1.6">RFC4098</xref>) of paths within the BMP
                session. For instance, if path marking is configured, and a
                non-installed path changes status to a backup route, the
                device should send an update about this path with the new
                markings, even if its BGP attributes remain unchanged.  Enabling reason
                codes could additionally increase the churn. Churn could be
                more pronounced during the start of a BGP session, where the
                    device is processing all available routes.</t>

                <t>If churn is undesired, an implementation could make use of
                "state compression" to hide state until paths converge (<xref
                    target="RFC7854" sectionFormat="of" section="5" />). It 
                    could also initially send BMP routes without the path
                    marking TLV, even if it were configured, and then add them
                    once the implementation considers the path to be stable
                    enough.  This document does not provide a definitive
                    solution for churn since it depends on the capabilities of
                    an implementation and the requirements of an operator. </t>

        <section title="Paths with no markings">

            <t>Some BGP routes might not require any type of status or reasons.
            For example, a path in Adj-RIB-In where the BGP best path decision has
            not been applied yet, falls under this category, since there is
            really nothing to mark for that path.  This document suggests applying an
            explicit marking of this route, by attaching a BMP path marking TLV
            with no bits set. This will help BMP monitor stations to differentiate
            this case from those in which markings are not configured, or not yet 
                attached by the device.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Path markings applicability and consistency" anchor="path_inconsistencies">

            <t>The status and reason codes from <xref target="status_codes"/>
            and <xref target="reasons_codes"/> are included based on use cases
            from network operators and defined following the most relevant
            protocol references available.  While implementations are strongly
                encouraged to align with these code definitions, this document
                does not enforce strict validity rules for code combinations to
                accommodate the diversity of BGP implementations.</t>

            <t>The experience during testing of this TLV revealed scenarios
            where implementations might combine codes differently than
            originally anticipated. For example, one test implementation marked
            routes with both 'Invalid' and 'Best' status bits set, which is
                contradictory from the point of view of <xref
                    target="RFC4271"/>, but made sense for their specific
                    implementation.</t>

            <t> Operators should apply their own validation checks on the data
                from TLVs and discuss potential inconsistencies with their
                vendors, and raise bugs if applicable. </t>

        <section title="Significance of status and origin RIBs">

            <t>This document refrains from imposing on any implementation the requirement to mark
            specific status from specific RIBs. Some implementations might be
            able to mark some status over one RIB while others do it on others.
            For instance, some might be able to mark Adj-RIB-In filtered routes
            when obtained from the Adj-RIB-In pre, while other could do it only
            from the Adj-RIB-In post. To remove ambiguities in implementations,
            it is recommended that the meaning of status (and reason codes)
                does not depend on the origin RIB of a route.</t>

        <section title="Multiple TLVs assigned to the same route.">

            <t>We advocate for the use of TLV grouping wherever feasible (<xref
                target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv" sectionFormat="of"
                section="5.2.1."/>). The inclusion of all marking information
                within a single message is recommended. In situations where
                multiple TLVs are associated with a single route, all markings
                and reasons will be applicable to that route.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Enterprise-specific status" anchor="ebit_mixed">

            <t>Implementations introducing their own status and reason codes
                are advised to adhere to <xref
                    target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit"/>  and use the
                    enterprise-bit (ebit) for vendor-specific status and
                    reasons.</t>

            <t>For scenarios where a path state combines a standard status with
                an enterprise-specific reason code (or vice versa), the
                following alternatives are presented:</t>

            <t> 
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Replication of the standard
            definitions within the enterprise-specific space, thus permitting
                    direct marking within the same packet using the ebit.</t> 
                <t>Assigning two TLVs to the same path(s): one containing the standard
                    part and another housing the vendor-specific part.</t> 
                </list>
            </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Multiple reason codes" anchor="multiple_reasons">
            <t>The path marking TLV was not designed to optimally hold more than
                one reason code per path.  However, if needed
                by a specific use case, the implementation can use two or more
                path markings TLVs for the same path listing the multiple
                reasons that apply to it.</t>
